    <b>Important Concepts</b>
    <p>
      The <em>World Wibe Web</em> is a collection of documents, most are made up of HTML.<br>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.<br>
      The browser reads, interprets, and displays these documents.<br>
      Servers are computers that host files that make up the web.<br>
      Computers make requests via the internet to servers, the internet and servers communicate through http.<br>
      HTTP is the main protocol of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Coding</em> is when programmers write text in a language computers understand, so the computer can follow the instructions.<br>
      Computers are stupid, even a small mistake like a typo can break the whole program.<br>
      There are too many details to remember everything, so programmers can just look something up if they forget how to do it.

      <em>Basic HTML vocabulary:</em><br>
      <em>Tag</em> - HTML tags are always contained in angle brackets < >.
      Most tags have opening < > and closing < / > tags, but some tags called void tags do not require a closing tag.<br>
      <em>Element</em> - An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
      <em>Attribute</em> - This is a property of an HTML element, such as the url in < a href = "url" >
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Misc notes</em><br>
      There are inline tags and block tags -
      block tags create an invisible box or container around the content that has a height and width,
      while inline tags do something within the line.<br>
      In HTML all "whitespace" turns into a single space.
      To make a new line render you'd need to use the break tag or the paragraph tag.<br>
      HTML documents are made up of text content (what you see),
      markup (what it looks like), references to other documents (such as images or videos),
      and links to other pages.
